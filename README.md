# 3D Basketball Visualization with Pycairo

A visually realistic 3D basketball illustration built using Python and the Pycairo graphics library. This project utilizes advanced computer graphics techniques to create depth, texture, and accurate curvature lines for a lifelike basketball design.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Bezier curves, gradients, and radial shading to simulate a 3D basketball effect in 2D graphics. With Pycairo, a powerful vector graphics library, this project combines artistry and programming to bring a basketball to life, complete with textured shading and realistic seam curves.

## Features

- **3D Sphere Representation**: Uses radial gradients to give the basketball a realistic 3D appearance.
- **Basketball Seam Curves**: Bezier curves simulate the characteristic lines on a basketball, including intersecting diagonal and vertical seams.
- **Texture and Shading**: Applied color gradients and shadows for depth and texture.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pycairo Library**

Install Pycairo using pip:
```bash
pip install pycairo
